# Hacktoberfest '22: Contribute to Voice Dataset - Common Voice (EN)

Mozilla Common Voice is an initiative to help teach machines how real people speak.

Voice is natural, voice is human. That’s why we’re excited about creating usable voice technology for our machines. But to create voice systems, developers need an extremely large amount of voice data.

Now you can donate your voice to help us build an open-source voice database that anyone can use to make innovative apps for devices and the web. Read a sentence to help machines learn how real people speak. Check the work of other contributors to improve the quality. It’s that simple!
